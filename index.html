    <p> <b>Chris Mochinski</b> - commonly referred to as <b>"Mo"</b> in personal and
       professional circles alike - is a professional musician and leasing consultant
      turned software-developer-hopeful with over two decades of experience 
      (DABBLING) in HTML, multimedia production, animation and more. 
      While attending Coon Rapids High School in 
      the final years of the 1900s, Mo accidentally skipped C++ level 1 and went straight
      to level 2 due to a school system error. He passed. Barely.
    </p>
    <p> In his very early teenage years, Mo found himself following in the footsteps of his 
      encouraging, tech-driven father and coding super basic DOS Q & A programs just for fun. It was at this
      time that he mastered his typing skills and speed - completely by accident - via writing an <i>actual novel</i>. It was about 
      Mortal Kombat guys and stuff. While it could potentially still be found on a comically small Compaq Presario hard drive in a landfill somewhere in
      the northwest suburbs, please do not ask to read it.</p>
    
    <p>
      Later in his teenage years, Mo tought himself to build rudimentary websites and even utilized SWiSH Max to create flash content. These skills were mostly used 
      in crafting sites for fellow artists, bands, musicians, photographers etc. In his late 20s, Mo decided
      to take a stab at animation. An educational <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnktXHBvE8s" target="_blank" style="color:#D7DEF0">Charles Darwin project</a> with nearly 900K views, which he clumsily produced
      in a single (albeit long) night in 2015, can still be seen on YouTube to this day. It continues to be 
      used in scientific curriculums around the world.
    </p>
    <p>Mo is massively driven in, exceptionally passionate about and thoroughly fascinated by the world of computer technology and coding in general. He would love nothing more than
      the opportunity to learn, alongside a group of his peers and from the talented folks at Prime Digital Academy, how to do pursue a career in development and, most importantly, how to do things <i>the right way</i>.
    </p>
    
   <p>
     Please do not hesitate to reach out to Mo with any questions or comments! He would genuinely love to hear from you!
